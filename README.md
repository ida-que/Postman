## Postman
This is my Postman portfolio where you can find the following folders:

1. [homework_1](https://github.com/ida-que/Postman/tree/main/homework_1)
2. [homework_2](https://github.com/ida-que/Postman/tree/main/homework_2)
3. [homework_3](https://github.com/ida-que/Postman/tree/main/homework_3)

All the files have JSON format, so you can download them and add to your Postman to see how the requests, responses, environments look. </br>
Also, there are files with collection runs to see the results of written tests. </br>

### Short descriptions of each folder:
* **homework_1** collection contains `GET` and `POST` requests as well as variable for the URL (no tests yet).
* **homework_2** collection is similar to **homework_1**, but also has several tests for almost every endpoint mentioned in the previous folder. At some test scripts, you can also find some scripts in `Javascript` language to display results in the console.
* **homework_3** collection represents normal tests as well as more advanced tests and scripts, e.g. interactions with collection and environment variables.
